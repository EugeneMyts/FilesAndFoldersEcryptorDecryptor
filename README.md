Files and Folders Encryptor/Decryptor

This project is a desktop application with a user-friendly interface that allows users to encrypt and decrypt their files and folders using a password-based encryption algorithm. The application provides a convenient and secure way to protect sensitive data by converting it into an encrypted format that can only be accessed with the correct password.

Features

1.The Files and Folders Encryptor/Decryptor application offers the following features:

2.User Interface: The application is built with a user-friendly interface that makes it easy for users to navigate and interact with the encryption and decryption functionalities.

3.File Encryption: Users can select individual files or entire folders to encrypt. The application encrypts the selected files/folders using a password-based encryption algorithm, ensuring the security of the data.

4.File Decryption: Encrypted files/folders can be decrypted using the same password that was used for encryption. The application decrypts the files/folders and restores them to their original format.

5.Password Security: The application uses a robust password-based encryption algorithm to securely encrypt and decrypt files/folders. Users are required to enter the correct password to perform encryption or decryption operations.
